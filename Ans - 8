The buddyStrings function takes two strings s and goal as input and returns true if it is possible to swap two letters in s to obtain goal, and false otherwise.

The algorithm checks for the following cases:

If the lengths of the strings are not equal, they cannot be made equal by swapping two letters, so it returns false.
If the strings are equal, it checks if there are any repeated characters. If there are, it is possible to swap two identical letters to obtain the same string, so it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
If the strings are not equal, it finds the first pair of different characters in the strings. If there are more than two different characters, it is not possible to make the strings equal by swapping two letters, so it returns false.
If there is only one pair of different characters, it checks if swapping the characters at the first and second indices results in the goal string. If it does, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
Finally, in the main method, we create an instance of the Solution class, initialize the input strings, and call the buddyStrings method to determine if it is possible to swap two letters. The result is then printed to the console.
